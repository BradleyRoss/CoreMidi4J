<h2>gh_pages</h2>
<p>For GitHub, the gh_pages branch contains the documentation for the
   project.  For my fork, the gh_pages branch can be viewed
   using <a href="http://bradleyross.github.io/CoreMidi4J" target="_blank">
   http://bradleyross.github.io/CoreMidi4J</a>.  You might want to 
   consider setting up such a branch for your project.</p>
<p>Please note that this site contains the Javadoc files for the Java
   code and the <a href="http://www.doxygen.org" target="_blank">
   dOxygen</a> documention for the C (and C-like) code.</p>
<h2>javah</h2>
<p>The command javah is part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) and
   creates a C/C++ header file for Java Native Interface (JNI)
   methods.  In this project, the pom.xml file ran javah against the classes
   containing JNI methods
   (CoreMidiClient, CoreMidiDestination, CoreMidiDeviceProvider,
   CoreMidiDeviceProvider.MidiProperties, and CoreMidiInputPort, CoreMidiOutputPort,
   CoreMidiSource) and creates the file CoreMidi4J.h.  (CoreMidiDeviceProvider.MidiProperties
   was added to the list because it was used in other JNI methods.)<p>
<p>Any changes to the Java classes may result in changes to CoreMidi4J.h and
   this would require changes to the other C++ source files and headers.  I therefore feel 
   that you should remove the execution of javah from the pom.xml configuration.  Since
   any changes in the results will mean changes to the C code, the use of javah
   should be part of a manual step.</p>
<h2>dOxygen</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.doxygen.org" target="_blank">dOxygen</a> is a documenting
   tool for C-like languages.  You can download the dOxygen program from the
   website and then run it against the source code in the Native folder to
   get a set of documentation.</p>
<p>I'm still trying to figure out how to limit the filenames to avoid the full
   name with all directories.  (I'm using a new version of dOxygen and running it 
   differently.  See</p>
