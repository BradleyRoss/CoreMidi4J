    http://bradleyross.github.io/CoreMidi4J</a> Documentation branch (gh-pages)
    for my fork.</li>
</ul>
<h2>gh-pages</h2>
<p>For GitHub, the gh-pages branch contains the documentation for the
   project.  For my fork, the ghpages branch can be viewed
   using <a href="http://bradleyross.github.io/CoreMidi4J" target="_blank">
   http://bradleyross.github.io/CoreMidi4J</a>.  You might want to 
   consider setting up such a branch for your project.</p>
<p>Please note that this site contains the Javadoc files for the Java
   code and the <a href="http://www.doxygen.org" target="_blank">
   dOxygen</a> documention for the C (and C-like) code.</p>
<p>The Doxygen files were created by the doxygen software as a 
   separate task.  The configuration of the options file (Doxygen)
   results in the output being written to the gh-pages branch.
   The root file of the documentation is in the directory
   doxygen/html.</p>
<p>The Javadocs are created as part of the Maven build.  The contents of 
   site/apidocs directory are thn copied to the apidocs directory of the
   gh-pages branch.</p>
<h2>javah</h2>
<p>The command javah is part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) and
   creates a C/C++ header file for Java Native Interface (JNI)
   methods.  In this project, the pom.xml file ran javah against the classes
   containing JNI methods
   (CoreMidiClient, CoreMidiDestination, CoreMidiDeviceProvider,
   CoreMidiDeviceProvider.MidiProperties, and CoreMidiInputPort, CoreMidiOutputPort,
   CoreMidiSource) and creates the file CoreMidi4J.h.  (CoreMidiDeviceProvider.MidiProperties
   was added to the list because it was used in other JNI methods.)<p>
<p>Any changes to the Java classes may result in changes to CoreMidi4J.h and
   this would require changes to the other C++ source files and headers.  I therefore feel 
   that you should remove the execution of javah from the pom.xml configuration.  Since
   any changes in the results will mean changes to the C code, the use of javah
   should be part of a manual step.  A bash shell script in the directory might
   be best.</p>
<h2>dOxygen</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.doxygen.org" target="_blank">dOxygen</a> is a documenting
   tool for C-like languages.  You can download the dOxygen program from the
   website and then run it against the source code in the Native folder to
   get a set of documentation.</p>
<p>I have placed a file Doxygn in Native/CoreMidi4J that contains the options for
   running Doxygen.  You can read this file from within Doxygen to set up the 
   configuration.  You will have to change the following parameters to match the
   file structure on your system.
<ul>
<li>Source directory - This is the directory containing the C++ source (cpp) and
     header files (h) files.</li>
<li>Destination directory - This is the directory into which you want the documentation
    to be generated.  The root file for the documentation is <code>html/index.html</code>
    with all of the files contained in the html subdirectory.</li>
<li>Working directory - This is the directory used for the generation of temporary files.</li>
</ul>
<h2>pom.xml</h2>
<p>I have some questions about some of the items in the <code>pom.xml</code> file.  It looks'
   like some of the plugins may not be used, and others have questionable parameters.</p>
<h2>Temporary Directory</h2>
<p>The code for creating the temporary directory and moving the dynamically linked library there
   looks like some modifications would help reliability.  I will expand this section when I
   look at it a little more.
<h2>Possible System Dependencies</h2>
<p>The file <code>Native/CoreMidi4J/java_home is a pointer to the home directory of your JDK
   (Java Development Kit).  Depending on your development system configuration, it may be 
   necessary this file to point to the correct directory.</p>
