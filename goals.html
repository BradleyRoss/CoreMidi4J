<li>The Core Java API is not notified when changes are made to the MIDI devices attached to the system.</li>
<li>The Core Java API does not update the list of devices when MIDI devices are attached or detached from the system.</li>
<li>does not support System Exclusive messages (from DerekCook/CoreMidi4J web site)</li>

<li>Each call to MidiSystem.getSynthesizer() yields a new object rather than returning the existing
       synthesizer object.  This also applies to using MidiSystem.getMidiDevice(MidiDevice.Info) for the 
       MidiDevice.Info for the synthesizer device.  All objects for the MidiDevice synthesizer object
       return the same MidiDevice.Info object.</li>
